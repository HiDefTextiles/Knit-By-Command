# HiDef Textiles: Knit-by-Command
## Abstract
The HiDef Textile Project is a pioneering initiative led by the **University of Iceland** in partnership with the **Iceland University of the Arts**. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional craft and modern technology by integrating Generative AI into old knitting machines. This project transforms these machines into interactive educational platforms, making it possible for students of machinery, software, and design to engage in hands-on learning. Through AI prompts, users can influence knitting patterns, promoting active engagement in STEAM education with a focus on practical applications in engineering and design.

## Goals
- **Innovate with Tradition**: Modernize traditional knitting machines with Generative AI, blending heritage crafts with new technologies.
- **Foster Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Encourage students from machinery, software, and design backgrounds to collaborate, creating a multidisciplinary learning environment.
- **Advance STEAM Education**: Utilize project-based learning and professional mentorship to deepen understanding and engagement in the fields of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics.
- **Open Access to Knowledge**: Share comprehensive documentation and resources freely, promoting educational inclusivity and participation.
